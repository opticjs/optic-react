# Optic React

The official React bindings for Optic. It provides declarative data fetching for React components. Optic React is inspired by Relay, but designed to work with arbitrary back-ends (so there's no dependency on GraphQL). Optic works with REST out of the box, but it can be configured to use a custom adapter if your API is based on WebSockets, JSONP, etc.
